What is your favorite movie?

      "Star War the Third Gathers: Backstroke of the West"

If you could go anywhere in the world for vacation, where would it be?

      Mariana Trench. but really, it depends on which type of vacation it is.


If you could have any super power, what would it be (and why that power)?

      Ability to distribute powers to other people- at the cost of their undying loyalty to me.
Sadly, it would have to be a striker (touch based) power, and most likely the powers I give out would only
last a proportionatly long time in relation to their own power level.
In order to keep it fair and not cause a loop, I would not be able to
give out other trump powers (powers which have to do with other powers)

Note: loyal to me does not mean under my control, just that they don't wish to cause me harm
and generally wish to further my goals.
Note2: cannot give powers to non-human beings. (Manton Effect)
Note3: cannot give to myself, obviously
Note4: fine, was told I need a downside. I feel pain of every bit of harm caused by my powers.
Note5: I only loosely control which types of powers I distrubute,
basically I control the classification and a little bit of the power ranking,
(brute, mover, shaker, master, stranger, changer, striker, blaster, tinker, thinker, etc)
(1-7, lets say, with 7 lasting only minutes and 1 lasting months)
Maybe I know to much about superpowers to make this useful.
